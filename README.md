## My process

I used gulp to compile my SASS to CSS, as such I had to set up my gulp.js and then create components for my styles. I went top-down approach with the build, and saved functionality(JS) for last.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Gulp.js(for compiling Sass among other things)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a few more about the usage of lacal storage, I used it to store preferences for the themes.
I also learnt about arial- label attributes for html tags.
I also learnt about the sibiling selector in CSS.
